## A free, libre, open source app for logging driving time

This app was created to help me get better at React Native -- it may not work amazing! If you find any issues, please create an issue.

While the app works on both Android and iOS, I do not currently have an Apple developer license (or Apple devices on which I can fully test the app). If you wish to run the app on iOS, you will need to build it yourself using Expo.

## Installation
On Android, the app can be downloaded and sideloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/lexidevs/driving-log/releases).
